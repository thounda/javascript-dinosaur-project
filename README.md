Udacity JavaScript Product - Dinosaur Demo

**Steps to implement the Object Oriented Javascript project:**

1. **Clone the repository and install the dependencies:**

`git clone git@github.com:udacity/Javascript.git`
`npm install`

2. **Decide how you will work with classes:**

You can either use the traditional class syntax or the ES6 class syntax. The traditional class syntax is as follows:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    // Code
  }
}
```

The ES6 class syntax is as follows:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  // Code
}
```

3. **Build out your classes and objects:**

Once you have decided how you will work with classes, you need to build out your classes and objects. You will need to create a class for each type of object that you will be using in your project. For example, you will need to create a class for the human object, the dinosaur object, and the tile object.

4. **Get human data from the HTML form to build your human object:**

You can use the `document.querySelector()` method to get the HTML form element. Once you have the form element, you can use the `document.querySelector()` method to get the values of the form fields. You can then use these values to create your human object.

5. **Create at least 3 methods that compare dino data to human data:**

You can create methods that compare the human's data to different aspects of the dinosaur's data, such as the dinosaur's height, weight, or diet. For example, you could create a method that compares the human's height to the dinosaur's height.

6. **Generate tiles and append to the DOM:**

Once you have compared the human's data to the dinosaur's data, you can generate tiles and append them to the DOM. You can use the `document.createElement()` method to create the tile elements. You can then use the `document.querySelector()` method to get the grid element. Once you have the grid element, you can use the `appendChild()` method to append the tile elements to the grid.

7. **Make certain the grid is not being added until you click the button to submit user data. Additionally, remove the form once the user has clicked to generate the infographic. It is a good idea to remove any calls to console.log at this point.**

You can use the `addEventListener()` method to add an event listener to the submit button. When the user clicks the submit button, the event listener will be triggered. The event listener can then call a function that will generate the grid and remove the form.

8. **REFACTOR:**

Once your code is working properly, you should refactor it. Refactoring is the process of improving the code without changing its functionality. You can refactor your code by making it more readable, efficient, and maintainable.
